  <h2>Itto claims to be the "first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang,"
     the responsibilities and duties of which he tried to explain to some
     Tenryou Commission officials when they came to him to investigate a
     rather harmless street brawl. Unfortunately, they interrupted him
     not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as
     "unemployed." That designation is not exactly accurate, of course:
     other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not
     acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually
     working one day before taking three days off. As such, a more
     accurate designation should have been "three-quarters
     unemployed."</h2>
